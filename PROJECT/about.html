      <h2>About Sustainable Living</h2>
      <p>Our Mission is to inspire and educate youth and adults to build a more enduring, resilient and just future by creating interactive experiences that highlight the regenerative economy in action.
        Local or organic? Hybrid or electric? Paper or plastic or neither? Nearly all decisions today affect the environment, figuring out which choices matter most often feels impossible. 
That's why we made Tree hugger, the only modern sustainability site that offers advice, clarity, and inspiration for both the eco-savvy and the green-living novice. With 2.6 million monthly users, Tree hugger is one of the world's largest information sites dedicated to driving sustainability mainstream.
Staying informed and making smart choices is critical during this time of environmental change and opportunity. But our nearly 20-year-strong library of sustainability content is here to help. Our articles can give you the confidence to purchase a better dishwasher, build a green beauty routine, or simply learn more about the world around you.
We don't care if you're just starting to BYO bags or have been composting for decades, welcome to Tree hugger. Sustainability for all.

<h1>Our History</h1>
    <p>
    Treehugger was founded by entrepreneur and eco-advocate Graham Hill in 2004. With a background in architecture and design, Hill's vision was for the site to serve as a vehicle for driving sustainability mainstream - and to do so with a modern twist.
  In 2007, TIME included Treehugger in their selection of “Top 25 Blogs” and Nielsen Online ranked Treehugger as the number one sustainability blog. The small staff grew into an international team of experts, and more accolades followed.
  The site was acquired by Discovery Communications in 2007, and in 2012 Mother Nature Network (part of the Narrative Content Group) took over. In 2020, both Mother Nature Network and Treehugger were acquired by Dotdash Meredith, where they are now one big happy family.
  In a 2004 post about the criteria Treehugger would use in deciding what to cover, the team explained that the primary goal of the site was to make it easy for consumers to research and purchase environmental yet compelling products and services, as well as to inspire corporate responsibility. “TreeHugger's criterion will evolve over time,” they wrote. “Our initial approach will be loose as we get our sea-legs.
